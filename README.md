🔖 bookmark-saver

bookmark-saver is a responsive, beginner-friendly web application that allows users to save, organize, and manage their favorite website links easily. The project is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using localStorage to save bookmarks directly in the browser so that they remain available even after refreshing or closing the tab.

🧭 Description

Bookmark Saver provides a simple and efficient solution for managing frequently visited websites.
Instead of using browser bookmarks, this app gives users full control to add custom website titles, store URLs, view them in a clean layout, and delete unwanted links anytime.

It’s lightweight, fast, and fully client-side — no server or database is required. The use of JavaScript’s localStorage ensures that all data stays stored locally, making it secure and offline-accessible.

This project is an excellent practice for front-end developers who want to enhance their understanding of:

DOM manipulation

Event handling

Local storage usage

Responsive design with CSS

✨ Features

🔗 Add bookmarks: Save any website with a custom title and link.

🗑️ Delete bookmarks: Remove any saved site instantly.

💾 Local storage: Bookmarks persist even after refreshing or closing the browser.

📱 Responsive layout: Works perfectly on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

⚡ Lightweight and fast: No backend or frameworks — just pure HTML, CSS, and JS.
